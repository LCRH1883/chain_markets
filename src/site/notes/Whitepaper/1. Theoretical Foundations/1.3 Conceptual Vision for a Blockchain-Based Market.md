This section articulates the target-market design: a **permissioned, legally anchored blockchain** that functions as a next-generation equity market. It preserves the protections of corporate and securities law while delivering real-time settlement, transparent ownership, programmable share classes, and integrated compliance. The result is a unified environment where companies can raise capital, investors can participate with clarity and confidence, and regulators can supervise with live telemetry rather than delayed reports.

### 1.3.1 Market Model and Roles

**Permissioned network.** The market is operated by approved validator/host institutions (e.g., banks, transfer agents, regulated ATS/MTFs, university consortia). Identity is mandatory for all issuers, validators, and investors to satisfy KYC/AML and market-abuse controls.

**Roles and responsibilities.**

- **Issuers (companies, funds, research entities):** create multi-class equity tokens, disclose information, and execute corporate actions on-chain.
  
- **Investors (accredited → broader retail as permitted):** hold and trade equity tokens, vote where entitled, and participate in on-chain governance processes aligned to company law.

- **Validators/Hosts:** run consensus, enforce rule-sets, apply sanctions lists/whitelists, and provide market resilience.
 
- **Regulators:** operate read-only observer nodes, monitor disclosures, surveillance signals, and systemic-risk metrics in real time.

- **Service providers:** oracles (corporate actions, FX, benchmarks), auditors, and compliance analytics vendors.

### 1.3.2 Core Principles and Features

**Unified ledger = real-time cap table.** Each issuer’s token contract is the authoritative register of ownership, rights, and encumbrances. Stakeholders share a single, canonical truth—no reconciliation across disparate intermediaries.

**Programmable equity.** Share classes (e.g., Class A voting, Class B non-voting, preferred) are implemented as distinct token classes with embedded rules: voting weight, dividend preference, convertibility, vesting/lockups, and transfer constraints.

**Instant (or near-instant) settlement.** Delivery-versus-payment at the ledger layer collapses counterparty exposure windows. Margin and collateral demands fall, liquidity improves, and shock events tied to delayed settlement are minimized.

**Compliance by construction.** Whitelists/blacklists, jurisdictional rules, holding periods, resale restrictions, insider tagging, and vote-locks are enforced by smart contracts and validator policy, not by manual post-trade checks.

**Transparent encumbrance tracking.** Loans against shares, liens, lockups, and securities lending positions are flagged on-chain. Adjusted-free-float and pledge ratios are observable in real time, reducing surprise liquidations and information asymmetry.

### 1.3.3 Data and Reporting Fabric

**Event-native disclosures.** Corporate events (dividends, splits, buybacks, board changes, material updates) are posted as signed on-chain events that investor dashboards and regulator nodes ingest automatically.

**Surveillance and analytics.** The ledger emits normalized telemetry (e.g., insider trading signals, unusual pledge buildup, concentrated ownership) enabling continuous supervision without bespoke data collection.

**Interoperable APIs.** Regulator, issuer, and investor tooling consume the same canonical event feeds. This reduces reporting friction and eliminates inconsistencies between “what happened” and “what was reported.”

### 1.3.4 Lifecycle: Private-to-Public Continuum

**Private mode (restricted trading).** Early issuers operate under exemption frameworks: transfers limited to whitelisted investors, with holding periods and per-investor caps embedded in contracts.

**Graduated liquidity.** As issuers meet disclosure and governance thresholds, constraints relax: larger eligible pools, narrower holding periods, and permitted secondary trading windows.

**Public mode (broad trading).** Once full criteria are met, tokens become widely transferable within regulatory bounds. No “migration” needed—the same security gains broader marketability via rule updates and validator policy changes.

### 1.3.5 Stakeholder Value Propositions

**Issuers.** Lower friction to raise capital; granular share-class engineering without bespoke legal overhead; real-time cap table; built-in loan registry; optional liquidity support and lending rails.

**Investors.** Transparent rights and encumbrances; fractional access where permitted; earlier secondary liquidity; auditable voting and cleaner corporate actions.

**Regulators.** Continuous line-of-sight into trading, ownership, and disclosures; automated enforcement at the point of transfer; faster, data-driven interventions.

**Ecosystem.** A composable substrate for new financial primitives (e.g., equity-collateralized credit, milestone-linked financings, research royalty tokens) that remain compliant.

### 1.3.6 Example User Journeys

**Founder/issuer (tech spinout).**

1. Incorporates and configures Class A/B/Preferred tokens (A = control, B = public economics, P = investor preference).

2. Files disclosures; mints seed allocation subject to vesting and lockups.
 
3. Raises from whitelisted investors; transfer rules enforce jurisdictional limits.

4. Publishes on-chain milestones; unlocks broader liquidity as criteria are met.

5. Records loans/pledges to finance growth; encumbrances are public; voting locks prevent governance manipulation.

**Investor (institutional → retail).**

1. Onboards with KYC; receives eligibility credentials.

2. Subscribes to issuances with tailored rights (e.g., dividend-focused preferred).

3. Monitors on-chain disclosures, pledge ratios, and adjusted float; votes when entitled.
  
4. Accesses lending/credit against equity positions under conservative LTVs.


**Regulator.**

1. Connects a read-only node; sets alert thresholds (e.g., pledge spikes, insider trades).

2. Reviews issuer event streams and governance records.

3. Issues guidance; validators update rule-sets network-wide with auditable effect.


### 1.3.7 Why a Permissioned Chain (not a public free-for-all)

A permissioned design ensures reliable identity, enforceable compliance, predictable performance, and clear accountability. Public, anonymous systems struggle to meet statutory requirements for investor protection and market integrity. Here, **identity, auditability, and legal recourse** are integral to market function rather than bolted on.

### 1.3.8 Bridge to Recursive Research Funding (Preview of §1.7)

Because equity is programmable and encumbrances are transparent, the market can host **recursive funding constructs**: a university or fund issues a “root” token; successful spinouts fork into their own tokens while streaming residual value (royalty, equity fragments, or fee flows) back to the root. This creates a **self-replenishing innovation flywheel** that complements public grants and traditional VC. Details appear in §1.7 and are operationalized by the share-class and registry mechanisms described here.
