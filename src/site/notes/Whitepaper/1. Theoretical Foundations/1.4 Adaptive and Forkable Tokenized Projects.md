In blockchain ecosystems, it is increasingly feasible for new ventures or tokens to “fork” off from an existing project, similar to spin-off companies in traditional business. A parent tokenized project (often a DAO or protocol) can incubate a **sub-project with its own token**, while retaining some ties to the origin. For example, _SubDAOs_ have emerged as a model: Fingerprints DAO (an NFT collector DAO) spun out the RAW DAO (a photography-focused DAO) by distributing a new $RAW token to backers, **while Fingerprints’ treasury kept 12.5% of the $RAW supply**[coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/7bfK9st2mvhxlla4XKotRjetq5-YhaiwqRwS8DhkD-o#:~:text=Fingerprints%20DAO%20,DAO). Similarly, PleasrDAO fractionalized the Doge NFT into a $DOG token, forming a new community; **PleasrDAO retained 55% of $DOG** in its treasury[coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/7bfK9st2mvhxlla4XKotRjetq5-YhaiwqRwS8DhkD-o#:~:text=After%20purchasing%20the%20DOGE%20NFT%2C,DOG%20supply%20in%20its%20treasury). Another case is Seed Club (a social-token incubator) launching a sub-DAO called mCLUB for grants, with **Seed Club’s treasury holding 15% of $MCLUB**[coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/7bfK9st2mvhxlla4XKotRjetq5-YhaiwqRwS8DhkD-o#:~:text=Seed%20Club%20). In each case, an existing tokenized entity created a new project token and kept an ownership stake, effectively **forking the project structure while tying value back to the origin**[coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/7bfK9st2mvhxlla4XKotRjetq5-YhaiwqRwS8DhkD-o#:~:text=divisions%2C%20teams%20and%20focuses%20brought,into%20a%20DAO%E2%80%99s%20orbit)[coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/7bfK9st2mvhxlla4XKotRjetq5-YhaiwqRwS8DhkD-o#:~:text=DAOs%20should%20own%20a%20percentage,governed%20in%20the%20Community%20Treasury). This approach allows the parent community to scale into new domains without housing everything under one token – much like a company creating a subsidiary – but on-chain and fluid.

Major protocols are also exploring structured forkable ecosystems. MakerDAO’s recent “Endgame” plan is explicitly **launching multiple specialized subDAOs** (each with its own governance token) under the Maker umbrella[chaincatcher.com](https://www.chaincatcher.com/en/article/2115345#:~:text=Phase%202%3A%20Launch%20of%20subDAOs)[chaincatcher.com](https://www.chaincatcher.com/en/article/2115345#:~:text=SubDAOs%20are%20specialized%20DAOs%20that,its%20own%20unique%20governance%20token). These subDAOs will operate semi-independently (focused on specific functions like governance processes or asset management), yet remain linked to Maker’s core (MKR holders retain control over certain subDAO assets and parameters)[chaincatcher.com](https://www.chaincatcher.com/en/article/2115345#:~:text=While%20they%20largely%20operate%20independently%2C,control%20over%20many%20subDAO%20assets). The goal is to reduce complexity in the main DAO by letting **new initiatives fork into sub-entities**, while still benefiting from Maker’s infrastructure and oversight. This demonstrates a _forkable project structure_ at scale: the Maker ecosystem can branch into many tokens/projects, each accountable for a niche, rather than bloating one monolithic DAO. The strength of this model is clear – it **fosters specialization and growth** by allowing new ideas to flourish with their own space and funding, **without completely severing ties to the parent’s resources and community trust**. A potential weakness, however, is **coordination overhead**: with many sub-tokens, governance and investor focus can fragment, and ensuring all offspring align with the original mission (or don’t over-leverage the parent) becomes a challenge.

Even without formal incubation, blockchain communities can fork themselves for strategic reasons. Nouns DAO, for instance, recently introduced a **permissionless fork mechanism** in its v3 upgrade, effectively a “ragequit” for unhappy members[theblockbeats.info](https://www.theblockbeats.info/en/news/45140#:~:text=Last%20month%2C%20Nouns%20DAO%20approved,rage%20quit). If a faction of Nouns NFT holders is dissatisfied, they can split off – **moving their proportional share of the treasury into a new forked DAO** – rather than being permanently bound by majority votes[theblockbeats.info](https://www.theblockbeats.info/en/news/45140#:~:text=As%20of%20September%209th%2C%20more,auctions%20in%20the%20past%20week). Over 20% of Nouns holders exercised this option, forking into a new group with ~10,758 ETH (their portion of assets)[theblockbeats.info](https://www.theblockbeats.info/en/news/45140#:~:text=As%20of%20September%209th%2C%20more,auctions%20in%20the%20past%20week). This is akin to a shareholder-initiated spin-off: it provides an outlet for divergent visions. The upside is **strong minority protection and the ability for parallel experimentation**, but the downside is that it **literally fragments the treasury and community**, potentially weakening the original project’s clout. In summary, current implementations range from _proactive spin-outs_ (parent-endorsed subDAOs launching new ventures) to _reactive forks_ (community-led splits in case of discontent). Each demonstrates the core idea of **forkable tokens**: on-chain projects can branch into distinct entities across various sectors (art, DeFi, social, etc.), rather than remaining single and indivisible.

## Mechanisms for Residual Value Sharing in Forked Ecosystems

A critical design aspect of forkable token ecosystems is ensuring the origin project continues to derive value from its “children.” In traditional corporate spin-offs, the parent often retains an equity stake or earns royalties – blockchain analogues are emerging. The simplest mechanism is **equity-like ownership**: the parent project’s treasury or stakeholders hold a percentage of the new forked token. This was evident in the subDAO examples (e.g. 10–15% retention of the new tokens) and is often recommended as best practice. DAO thought leaders suggest a parent DAO should own on the order of _5–15%_ of each subDAO’s tokens, which **boosts the parent treasury’s net asset value as the sub-project succeeds**[coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/7bfK9st2mvhxlla4XKotRjetq5-YhaiwqRwS8DhkD-o#:~:text=%2A%20Attract%20new%20members%20,get%20exposure%20to%20all%20SubDAOs). Essentially, the parent token becomes a portfolio: its value grows if any of the spin-offs “moon,” providing a **recursive funding logic** where successful forks financially loop back to support the origin. This aligns incentives – early supporters of the parent benefit from downstream innovation – much like a venture studio or holding company model on-chain.

Another approach is **programmed value streams** (royalties or fees) from the forked project to the origin. Smart contracts can enforce that certain transactions or revenue in the child project automatically route a fraction back to the parent. An analogy is NFT royalties: creators set a rule so that every resale sends, say, 5% of the sale price back to the creator’s address. In a forkable token context, one could design the new venture’s token or protocol with a _built-in royalty to the parent DAO_. For example, a DeFi protocol fork might pay a small fee to the parent protocol for each trade or use of shared IP. **The “Forking Governance” proposal by Phelps/Prosperi explicitly suggests introducing fees that subDAOs must pay to the main DAO**, allowing the fork to operate its product but **streaming part of its revenue back to the parent**[notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/go-fork-yourself#:~:text=Solutions%20to%20those%20problems%20should,be%20minimized%20but%20not%20eliminated). This is akin to a franchise fee or a licensing royalty – the child gets independence to innovate, while the parent earns a passive residual from its offspring’s activity. Such value-streaming contracts could be structured as continuous micropayments (using protocols like Superfluid or Sablier) or periodic dividends to parent token holders.

Real-world precedents underscore the importance of residual value-sharing. In the **biotech and university spinout world**, it’s standard for the originating institution to secure both equity and royalties when a project is forked into a new company. On average, universities often take an equity stake (commonly **around 20%** in the UK historically, though trending lower for founder-friendliness) and may ask for royalties on future product sales[orrick.com](https://www.orrick.com/en/Insights/2024/12/Legal-Ninja-Snapshot-Technology-Transfers-How-much-should-a-University-hold-in-IP-based-Spin-Outs#:~:text=different%20types%20of%20spin,out)[fiftyyears.com](https://www.fiftyyears.com/spinout#:~:text=A%20note%20about%20royalties%3A%20Royalty,Healthcare%20Products%20and%20Supplies). For instance, a survey found UK universities had a mean ~22% initial equity in spin-outs (life sciences ~24%)[orrick.com](https://www.orrick.com/en/Insights/2024/12/Legal-Ninja-Snapshot-Technology-Transfers-How-much-should-a-University-hold-in-IP-based-Spin-Outs#:~:text=different%20types%20of%20spin,out), while top U.S. universities often target a smaller ~5% stake plus downstream royalties. **Median royalty rates in licensing deals hover around 3%** of revenue for the use of the core IP[fiftyyears.com](https://www.fiftyyears.com/spinout#:~:text=A%20note%20about%20royalties%3A%20Royalty,Healthcare%20Products%20and%20Supplies) – a figure that can be higher for very valuable patents (high single digits for something like CRISPR tech)[fiftyyears.com](https://www.fiftyyears.com/spinout#:~:text=This%20is%20skewed%20because%20the,Healthcare%20Products%20and%20Supplies). These arrangements mirror what blockchain projects might do: the originator contributes foundational assets (code, community, brand) and in return receives a _royalty or profit-share_ from the spin-off. The strength of this model is clear: it **lets the origin capture a long-tail of value** as forks thrive, preventing the scenario where a fork completely “runs off” with all the upside. It also provides funding to the parent for its own sustainability or to seed further ventures, creating a virtuous cycle.

However, there are trade-offs. If the parent’s residual claim is too large – e.g. exorbitant royalties or a majority token stake – the new project may be seen as overly encumbered, deterring investors or community adoption of the fork. Just as excessive university equity can **stifle a spinout’s ability to raise capital**[orrick.com](https://www.orrick.com/en/Insights/2024/12/Legal-Ninja-Snapshot-Technology-Transfers-How-much-should-a-University-hold-in-IP-based-Spin-Outs#:~:text=on%20the%20spin,challenges%20for%20the%20fledgling%20company)[orrick.com](https://www.orrick.com/en/Insights/2024/12/Legal-Ninja-Snapshot-Technology-Transfers-How-much-should-a-University-hold-in-IP-based-Spin-Outs#:~:text=Cambridge%20created%20137,3), an onerous value-sharing clause on a fork could undermine its competitive agility. Thus, successful implementations tend to set **moderate, sustainable shares** (like the single-digit royalties or ~10% equity examples above) that keep incentives aligned without strangling the child’s growth. Another challenge is enforceability: on open blockchains, a truly permissionless fork could copy a project’s code and _avoid_ any built-in fees (unless the code is licensed to prevent this). This is where _permissioned or legally wrapped markets_ might shine – if forks occur within a governed environment, smart contracts and legal agreements can enforce that any sanctioned fork has those royalty streams to the origin. In fully open ecosystems, alternatively, communities may rely on softer incentives: for example, **Nouns DAO uses a Creative Commons (CC0) license for its NFT art, allowing anyone to fork its IP freely, but the theory is that widespread forking of Nouns imagery will **increase the cultural relevance and value of the original Nouns** tokens**[notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/go-fork-yourself#:~:text=match%20at%20L657%20anyone%20to,more%20demand%20for%20any%20projects). In that case, residual value returns indirectly (via increased demand for the original token/brand) rather than via explicit fees. This “positive-sum forking” philosophy trusts that **if the ecosystem of derivatives grows, the origin’s value grows too**[notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/go-fork-yourself#:~:text=anyone%20to%20fork%20its%20IP%2C,more%20demand%20for%20any%20projects) – a dynamic often seen in open-source software as well.

In summary, robust forkable ecosystems typically incorporate _recursive value flows_: either through **holding equity in the spin-offs, instituting royalty-like fees, or fostering open proliferation that boosts the parent’s network effects**. The best model may combine approaches. For example, a parent DAO might hold a minority of tokens in each child **and** receive a small platform fee, covering both capital upside and ongoing revenue. This layered approach ensures the origin project is financially linked to descendants, creating a **recursive funding ladder** where each new project extends the ladder further but still supports the base.

## Governance Models for Approving and Managing Forks

Deciding **when and how a fork is allowed** is a governance question: Who consents to a new tokenized venture spinning out, and under what conditions? Various governance models exist, each with pros and cons. One common approach is **community voting** by the parent token holders. Under this model, a proposal to create or support a fork (spin-out) must pass a vote in the parent DAO. For instance, the creation of the dYdX Grants SubDAO (DPG) was executed via the community allocating funds to it – effectively, token holders **voted to endow a new sub-entity with capital from the main DAO’s treasury**[101blockchains.com](https://101blockchains.com/what-is-subdao/#:~:text=while%20ensuring%20compliance%20with%20payments,tax%20and%20reporting%20stipulations). This resembles a company’s shareholders approving a new subsidiary or division. The benefit is broad legitimacy: forks get a **mandate from the community**, ensuring they align with collective interests. It can also include setting terms via the proposal (e.g., “we approve spinning out Project X and the parent will retain Y% of tokens and/or a royalty contract”). The downside is speed and flexibility – holding a vote for each potential fork can be slow or politicized, potentially **stifling grassroots initiatives** that lack initial majority support. A closely related variant is requiring **parent token-holder consent** in a more passive form – for example, MakerDAO’s Endgame will still have MKR holders in ultimate control of subDAO parameters and could veto dangerous actions[chaincatcher.com](https://www.chaincatcher.com/en/article/2115345#:~:text=While%20they%20largely%20operate%20independently%2C,control%20over%20many%20subDAO%20assets). In corporate terms, this is like a parent company board retaining certain veto rights over subsidiaries.

Another model is **delegated or committee-based approval**. Instead of a full token vote on every fork, the community can establish a _“venture committee” or board_ empowered to greenlight spin-outs within certain guidelines. This might involve core team members or elected reps who evaluate proposals for new sub-tokens and decide if they proceed (much as a corporate board approves carving out a new company). The advantage is expertise and efficiency – a smaller group can assess viability and negotiate terms (equity share, etc.) more deftly than a mass vote. For example, some DAOs create grant committees or accelerator programs that effectively incubate new token projects under the DAO’s umbrella, without needing a full vote on each grant. However, this introduces centralization concerns: if the committee’s decisions diverge from token holder interests, it can cause contention. To mitigate that, the committee’s authority can be limited (e.g., only up to a certain budget or fork size, beyond which a full vote is needed).

On the other extreme is **permissionless forking** – allowing forks without any explicit approval, provided certain conditions are met. Nouns DAO’s on-chain fork mechanism is a case in point: it doesn’t require a vote to leave; any holder can opt to join a fork during the forking period if they prefer to exit[theblockbeats.info](https://www.theblockbeats.info/en/news/45140#:~:text=As%20of%20September%209th%2C%20more,to%20the%20average%20price%20of). Similarly, a _continuous governance forking model_ has been proposed wherein **if a significant minority (say 49.9%) votes “No” on a proposal, they automatically split off with 49.9% of the treasury into a new instance**[notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/go-fork-yourself#:~:text=But%20imagine%20now%20a%20world,WINNER%20token). In this hypothetical scenario, both factions (Yes and No) get to pursue their preferred roadmap with proportional funds – essentially _automated forking triggered by on-chain vote outcomes_. The benefit of permissionless or automatic forks is **maximum decentralization and freedom**: it prevents stalemates and tyranny of the majority, since dissatisfied groups can always go their own way. It also turns governance into a discovery mechanism: disagreements lead to more experiments rather than simply winners and disenfranchised losers[notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/go-fork-yourself#:~:text=The%20real%20promise%20of%20DAO,And%20it%20enables%20governance%20to). As Packy McCormick et al. put it, _forking is the ultimate form of decentralization – allowing each subcommunity to “create their own version” of the project if they desire_[notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/go-fork-yourself#:~:text=The%20real%20promise%20of%20DAO,And%20it%20enables%20governance%20to)[notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/go-fork-yourself#:~:text=Forking%20offers%20a%20third%20path,about%20their%20vision%2C%20they%E2%80%99ll%20succeed). In theory, this could drive innovation by letting contrarians prove their ideas independently, and **token holders could even choose to hold the original token (as an index of all forks) or swap into a specific fork they believe in**[notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/go-fork-yourself#:~:text=forks,we%20know).

The permissionless approach, however, introduces challenges. Frequent or unchecked forks can **excessively fragment liquidity and attention**. If, say, every contentious Uniswap proposal led to a new “Uniswap variant” with a slice of the treasury, soon you’d have many mini-DAOs each holding a fraction of the assets – not an ideal outcome for users needing deep liquidity in one place[notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/go-fork-yourself#:~:text=Even%20absent%20malicious%20actors%2C%20forking,Uniswap%20to%20exchange%20their%20tokens). There’s also the risk of **malicious forking attacks**: a participant with 10% of tokens could fork out 10% of the treasury unopposed, whereas in a normal vote they could never steal funds with just 10% vote share[notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/go-fork-yourself#:~:text=This%20type%20of%20forking%20system,uncontested%20in%20the%20forking%20model). To counter this, designs like the one above propose safeguards – for example, _limiting the maximum treasury portion that can be taken in any single fork_, or requiring a certain quorum/threshold to initiate a fork. Another idea is imposing a **“fork fee” or exit tribute**: when a group forks off, a small percentage of their share is left behind or paid to the parent as a cost[notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/go-fork-yourself#:~:text=Solutions%20to%20those%20problems%20should,be%20minimized%20but%20not%20eliminated). This both compensates the remaining community and discourages frivolous splits. Essentially, **the cost of forking should be non-zero** to prevent abuse, but not so high as to deter genuine, positive-sum forks[notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/go-fork-yourself#:~:text=Solutions%20to%20those%20problems%20should,be%20minimized%20but%20not%20eliminated). For instance, a DAO might allow free forking of _new projects_ (where the parent voluntarily seeds a subDAO), but require say a 5% penalty if people ragequit with treasury funds in an unsanctioned fork.

In a _permissioned token market context_, governance of forks might lean more on formal approvals. If we imagine a private or consortium-based blockchain equity market (where participants are known and legal contracts underpin the tokens), then forks would likely require explicit sign-offs – analogous to needing board and shareholder approval for corporate spin-offs. The **advantage in permissioned settings** is that rules about fork approvals and value-sharing can be encoded not just in smart contracts but in legal contracts, reducing ambiguity. For example, the network’s bylaws might state that any spin-out entity must grant the parent company a certain equity/royalty, and regulators or network operators could block unsanctioned forks from being recognized. Community voting could still play a role (to mimic shareholder votes), but one could also see **delegated oversight boards** ensuring compliance with broader market regulations when a project forks. The key is finding a governance balance that **facilitates innovation (so that promising new ideas can branch out freely) while maintaining cohesion and fairness**.

Each model has strengths and weaknesses. **Community voting** ensures democratic input but can be slow and subject to voter apathy or majority bias. **Delegate/board models** add expertise and speed, but concentrate power (which might be acceptable in a permissioned context with accountable representatives). **Open forking** maximizes freedom and pushes decision-making to the edges, but requires careful economic design to avoid instability. A hybrid approach may serve best: for example, _uncontentious forks (like launching a clearly value-adding sub-project) could be fast-tracked by a committee, whereas major ecosystem splits or treasury-dividing forks go to a full holder vote_. Additionally, **sunrise or circuit-breaker clauses** could be implemented – e.g., a fork proposal passes only if after 2 weeks no higher governance body vetoes it, ensuring both agility and oversight. Ultimately, governing forks is about _governing scale and evolution_: it asks how an organization-of-organizations can grow. In a well-designed system, **forks become a feature, not a bug** – a controlled way to pursue multiple paths in parallel, with mechanisms (like shared ownership or fees) to keep those paths interlinked rather than entirely divergent.

## Analogues and Successful Models in Other Domains

Forkable project structures are not an entirely new concept – they echo patterns in open-source software, licensing networks, and other collaborative systems. Examining these analogues provides insight into strengths and pitfalls that inform a blockchain equity market design:

- **Open-Source Software (Git/Linux model):** In open-source, _forking the codebase_ is a fundamental freedom. Anyone can copy a project’s repository and create their own variant without needing permission, as long as license terms are respected. This has led to a rich history of forks in software (for example, numerous Linux distributions forked from the same kernel). Notably, open-source licenses like MIT or Apache impose **no requirement to share financial gains** – only to attribute or share code under certain conditions (the GPL license requires forked code to remain open source, but again, no royalty). The _strength_ of this model is **rapid innovation and resilience**. If the core project maintainers stall or go astray, the community can fork and continue development in a new direction, as happened with projects like LibreOffice (forked from OpenOffice) or MariaDB (forked from MySQL). It’s a highly permissionless, meritocratic environment: the best fork can attract users and developers, potentially overtaking the original. However, the _weakness_ is that the original creators or community **capture little direct value from forks**. A successful fork might become a big commercial success (e.g., Android OS is effectively a fork of Linux for mobile), yet original Linux kernel developers don’t get royalties from Android’s profits. Instead, value flows back indirectly – perhaps via contributions to the shared code or the prestige that attracts funding to the Linux Foundation. Translated to tokenized ventures, the open-source analogy suggests that _completely unencumbered forks_ maximize growth and adoption, but one must rely on goodwill or ancillary benefits for the origin to profit. For a _permissioned equity market_, that pure model might not be financially sustainable for originators. Nonetheless, embracing some open-source principles – like making it technically easy to fork and encouraging interoperability – can prevent stagnation and **encourage a vibrant ecosystem of related projects**.
    
- **IP Licensing Networks (Patent Pools & Franchises):** In more traditional industries, when a core technology is reused across many derivatives, formal licensing networks ensure the original inventors are compensated. _Patent pools_ such as **MPEG LA** aggregate patents for standards (e.g., video codecs like H.264) and then license them out broadly. Companies building products with those standards pay royalties into the pool, which are **distributed to all the contributing patent holders**[patentpc.com](https://patentpc.com/blog/the-role-of-patent-pools-in-commercialization#:~:text=MPEG%20LA%20manages%20the%20licensing,holders%2C%20ensuring%20that%20the). This creates a positive-sum environment: many can “fork” the standard (build their own encoder/decoder implementations or devices), without constant litigation, while innovators receive residual income. Similarly, in franchising (e.g., McDonald’s franchising its restaurant model), a local operator can start a new franchise location (a fork of the business model) but owes fees/royalties to the franchisor. The _strength_ here is **monetary alignment** – the originator directly benefits from each new instantiation of the idea, providing a sustainable incentive to share and support forks. We see a parallel in **biotech spin-offs**: a university or pharma that licenses a drug IP to a spin-out often negotiates milestone payments and royalties on drug sales, so if the spin-out succeeds, the origin enjoys a slice of revenue. However, these arrangements tend to be **complex and centralized**. They rely on legal contracts and sometimes monopolistic control (e.g., MPEG LA’s pooled patents are tightly managed). The _weakness_ is reduced flexibility and openness – you can’t fork freely; you must play by the licensing terms (or face legal consequences). In a blockchain context, overly rigid licensing could **slow down innovation** or exclude community-driven forks that don’t have the means to pay fees. Therefore, a balanced approach might be warranted: use smart contracts to automate fair royalty sharing (reducing overhead and friction compared to legal processes), but keep fees low enough to **not discourage genuine community innovation**. One interesting theoretical framework is the idea of a **“recursive license”** (e.g., COSRL – Crown Omega Sovereign Recursive Licensing). It proposes that all forks and derivatives of a system _inherit an immutable license tree_ that enforces compliance and even audits descendants for authenticity[encyclopedia.pub](https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/58240#:~:text=,for%20license%20integrity%20at%20runtime). In such a scheme, **all descendant projects could be bound to certain obligations (like value-sharing or governance principles) by code**. This is a futuristic take inspired by legal DRM, which if viable, could solve the enforcement problem – though it raises its own concerns about complexity and freedom.
    
- **DAO Tooling and Precedents:** Within the crypto space itself, several DAO frameworks have piloted features relevant to forking and splits. The _Moloch DAO_ design (famous from 2019) did not allow project forks per se, but introduced **“ragequit”** – any member who disagrees with a decision can immediately withdraw their share of the treasury before it’s used[theblockbeats.info](https://www.theblockbeats.info/en/news/45140#:~:text=Last%20month%2C%20Nouns%20DAO%20approved,rage%20quit). This mechanism was a early attempt to prevent tyranny of the majority and ensure that those who funded the DAO can exit with their funds if they object to the direction. Ragequit is essentially a one-way fork for an individual’s stake (it doesn’t create a new organization; it just lets them leave with assets). It inspired later forking concepts by proving that _on-chain exit options_ build trust in communal funding. More recently, as mentioned, **Nouns DAO implemented a full-group forking mechanism**: if a subset of NFT holders want out, they can form a new forked DAO and take a proportional treasury share[theblockbeats.info](https://www.theblockbeats.info/en/news/45140#:~:text=As%20of%20September%209th%2C%20more,to%20the%20average%20price%20of). Interestingly, this was **approved via governance and coded in** – a sign that even highly decentralized communities see the value in formalizing fork procedures for healthy exits. On the tooling side, platforms like Aragon, DAOstack, and Colony make it easy to **spin up new DAOs (effectively new ventures)** and manage tokens, but linking them hierarchically is left to users. We are now seeing meta-governance tools that treat a network of DAOs as a unit – for example, **Gitcoin’s DAO has discussed sub-DAOs with their own tokens (GTC governance over many “sideDAOs”)**[gov.gitcoin.co](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-tokenomics-subdaos-updated-may-2025/19916#:~:text=%24GTC%20Tokenomics%20,aligning%20with%20the%20parent) and **DAOhaus’s UberHaus** which was a DAO of Moloch DAOs (members were other DAOs) to coordinate across them. These are early attempts at _recursive DAO structures_. The success of these has been mixed; while technically feasible, social coordination is hard. However, one success story is the **incubator-style model** used by some investment DAOs. For instance, **the LAO (a venture DAO)** or **MetaCartel Ventures** spin up legal entities for each investment or sub-project, essentially mini-companies whose equity (tokens) are partially held by the parent fund. This mirrors the subDAO examples (PleasrDAO, Seed Club, etc.) – it’s just done with legal wrappers. The _strength_ of DAO tooling in this context is the ability to quickly instantiate governance and token contracts for a new project (minutes to deploy a new DAO), and even do token swaps or airdrops between parent and child to establish ownership links. Yet, a _weakness_ is the lack of native protocol support for continuous coordination: once a subDAO is out in the wild, keeping alignment with the parent (beyond the initial token allocation) often depends on social goodwill or manually written agreements. This is why proposals like **“forking governance” by Phelps/Prosperi envision a more systematic approach**, where the process of forking and the ongoing relationships (like fee sharing, or even re-merging later) are governed by smart contract logic from the outset[notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/go-fork-yourself#:~:text=But%20imagine%20now%20a%20world,WINNER%20token)[notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/go-fork-yourself#:~:text=Solutions%20to%20those%20problems%20should,be%20minimized%20but%20not%20eliminated).
    

In reflecting on these analogues, it’s clear that a blockchain-based equity market with forkable tokens can draw **both cautionary tales and inspiration**. Open-source shows the power of permissionless innovation but warns that without incentive alignment, original contributors may be left unrewarded. Licensing networks show that sharing value is possible and can fuel an R&D ecosystem, but overly stringent terms can deter participation and need streamlined enforcement. DAO experiments demonstrate the technical viability of on-chain forking and splitting, while highlighting the importance of **governance structures that can handle potentially fractal organizations**.

## Applicability to a Permissioned Token Market and Conclusion

Designing a **permissioned tokenized equity market** with these concepts means operating in a semi-controlled environment (participants are known or vetted, and legal compliance is required) while trying to capture the dynamism of open crypto ecosystems. In such a context, _forkable project structures_ could be revolutionary: imagine a network where startup companies issue tokens on a private blockchain and can “spin off” new tokenized ventures as easily as copying code – but with built-in corporate-like agreements governing those spin-offs. The permissioned nature actually offers an advantage: **enforceability**. Value-sharing contracts (equity stakes, royalties, etc.) between parent and child projects need not rely solely on voluntary adherence; they could be baked into both the code _and_ legal contracts signed when projects join the network. For example, the market’s rulebook might stipulate that any project launching a new tokenized subsidiary must, say, grant 10% of its tokens to the parent and 2% to a common treasury as a network fee. Smart contracts could automatically effect this distribution at token minting, and legal recourse exists if someone tries to circumvent it off-chain. This dual approach of **“code is law” plus real law** could address many of the weaknesses observed in the wild open market.

A permissioned environment could also set **governance thresholds** for forks to balance stability and innovation. Perhaps any established project can create a small experimental fork (like a sandbox project) without full approval, but if they want to transfer more than 5% of assets or do a major spin-out, it requires a supermajority vote of the parent’s stakeholders or even regulator consent. This prevents reckless fragmentation of capital. Meanwhile, smaller-scale forks (which are crucial for innovation at the edges) aren’t smothered by red tape. The network operators could provide **standardized tooling**: imagine a “Fork This Project” button in a dashboard that guides founders through creating a new sub-token, automatically **linking the new venture to the origin with preset residual-sharing and governance links**. This reduces the friction that in normal settings might involve extensive negotiations or custom coding.

One must also consider **strengths and weaknesses in this specific context**. **Strengths:** A recursive, forkable model could greatly accelerate growth and adaptability of the market. Projects that find a novel opportunity can pursue it via a forked token venture _without_ having to uproot from the parent or go find entirely new capital – they can leverage parent resources and reputation. Investors in the permissioned market get diversified exposure: holding a parent token is akin to holding a basket of its spin-offs (especially if residual value flows are assured), which could make the market attractive for portfolio-style investment in innovation. Moreover, _governance can be more nuanced_: because participants are identified, mechanisms like quadratic voting or weighted board votes can be implemented to manage forks responsibly (e.g., institutional investors might have a bigger say on forks involving large asset transfers for legal reasons). **Weaknesses/risks:** The flipside is complexity and potential confusion. Traditional investors might find it hard to value a token if it has recursive claims on many layers of sub-projects. There’s risk of “**DAO sprawl**” – too many tokens and entities spinning out, creating a governance burden to monitor them all (imagine a parent company having 50 subsidiaries all requiring attention). Also, while permissioned settings help enforce rules, they may reduce one of the crypto superpowers: permissionless participation. Care must be taken that requiring approval for forks doesn’t recreate the very barriers the blockchain intends to lower for entrepreneurship. The challenge will be to **allow openness within a framework** – a delicate balance of freedom and control.

In conclusion, the concept of forkable tokens with recursive funding is about marrying the **fluid, evolutionary nature of open-source and crypto** with the **value capture and accountability of traditional equity structures**. Successful models in one domain often fail in the other if transplanted verbatim, but by studying them we can synthesize a new design. A blockchain-based equity market could implement **robust mechanics** such as: parent DAOs holding equity stakes in child tokens, smart contracts enforcing royalty streams, community votes or boards to vet major forks, and perhaps even “meta-governance” tokens that track an index of all sub-tokens’ performance. The strengths of this approach lie in its **scalability and adaptability** – it creates an ecosystem where innovation isn’t bottled up (teams can pursue new directions by forking) yet early supporters aren’t left behind (thanks to residual value sharing). It also introduces an intriguing **layer of recursive finance**: funding flows down to new ventures, and success flows back up in a continuous cycle, potentially addressing the perennial startup ecosystem question of how to reward originators for the spin-offs they enable.

Of course, careful attention must be paid to the **weaknesses**: fragmentation, governance overload, and complexity in tracking value. Mitigation strategies drawn from both theory and practice (e.g., limiting fork frequencies, requiring modest but nonzero fork fees, providing unified platforms for multi-token management) will be key. Nonetheless, this approach’s applicability to a permissioned market is promising. It could create a **permissioned yet innovative “micro-economy” of enterprises**, where ideas evolve Darwinically through forks (as in open source), but within a nurtured garden that ensures each new branch feeds the roots (as in patent pools or corporate groups). In many ways, it mirrors how large companies today operate with internal ventures and spin-outs – except here the process is transparent, community-governed, and accelerated by smart contracts. By highlighting both successful patterns (e.g., the subDAO token allocations that worked well) and cautionary tales (e.g., overly greedy equity grabs by universities hindering spinouts[orrick.com](https://www.orrick.com/en/Insights/2024/12/Legal-Ninja-Snapshot-Technology-Transfers-How-much-should-a-University-hold-in-IP-based-Spin-Outs#:~:text=Cambridge%20created%20137,3)), we see that **forkable, recursive funding ecosystems must be designed with balance**. When done right, they hold the potential to create a sustainable, self-replenishing market for innovation – one where every fork strengthens the whole, and value flows in an ongoing loop from parent to child and back again.
